# RiverScript Backend

Short History. 
Back in 2006ish, I worked on an AIML chat client. Over the years it has evolved, 
going from VB6, to VB.Net, C#, Client side JS, Node JS and now in a RiveScript project using Go.
The conversion of NodeJS to GoLang was done using ChatGPT and a bit of manual work.  

2023, I was sick of having to update my Node packages, so I decided to use ChatGPT to help me
convert from Node to Go... that said, now stuck mantaining 2 versions, since the Go performance
is substandard compared to Node (who would have thought!!!)
